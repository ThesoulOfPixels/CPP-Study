# CPP-Study
- Just some code written when learning C++.
- Nothing special.

### Why you git them?
It is convenient for me to continue from different devices and can be watched by others.

### What can I do?
You can view them. If you want, you can give me some advice, thanks! ฅ۶•ﻌ•♡

### How to run?
Make sure you have g++ compiler, type `g++ [filename] -o [file]` in the terminal.
Then type `./[file]`.
